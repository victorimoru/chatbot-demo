This government scheme has approved operators who recruit workers and sponsor visas for them to do seasonal horticultural work such as picking fruit or vegetables. \nThere are only five companies who are approved operators for the Seasonal Workers’ Scheme. They are known as Scheme Operators, and their names and websites are listed below. No other employer will be able to legally provide you with a seasonal worker visa or provide you with work in the UK.  \nSome of the Scheme Operators may use recruitment agents in your country to find workers. The agencies may be government or private agencies. The agents they are using will be listed on the operator’s website. Only use recruitment agents recommended by the Scheme Operator. \nSome of these operators are only recruiting from certain countries so check the link to make sure they are accepting applications from your country.\nAGRI-hr - https://www.agri-hr.com \nConcordia (UK) Ltd - https://www.concordia.org.uk/seasonal-work \nFruitful Jobs : https://www.fruitfuljobs.com/seasonal-worker-scheme\nHOPS Labour Solutions Ltd - https://www.hopslaboursolutions.com/sws \nPro-Force Limited - https://www.pro-force.co.uk/support/visa-information \n  \nWarning: You should not pay any agent or business to get a job.

There are many ways that people may try to trick you when you are applying to work abroad. They might use fake advertising, websites or social media to send offers for jobs that do not exist. To protect yourself, always: \nMake sure any communications you receive are from a genuine scheme operator. Legitimate offers will not be sent via WhatsApp or Telegram. Check on the scheme operator's website to find their contact information and check any communications you receive to make sure it is the same. Genuine operators will not ask you for payments as part of the recruitment process.\nDo not give your personal details (name, email, phone number, etc) to anyone unless you know that they are a genuine scheme operator. Do not post your personal details on a public website.\nScheme operators will never ask you for payment as part of the recruitment process. Never give a payment to anyone to find work, training, equipment or other fees.\nIf you have concerns, please contact the Scheme Operator or an approved agent.\n\nReturning to the UK\nHorticultural Seasonal Workers can work in the UK for a maximum of 6 months in any 12-month period. This means that you must wait 6 months before you can return to the UK on a new visa. You are not permitted to apply for an extension to stay in the UK.\n\nReturning to a farm\nEmployers benefit from hiring the same workers. Returning workers know what to expect and have experience. A farm may ask its best workers to return to work in the next season. However, you cannot be hired directly by a farm, you must go through the scheme operator for a certificate of sponsorship. Employers will notify the scheme operators of workers they want to hire again.\nYour scheme operator will contact you about the opportunity to return but you cannot apply for a visa more than 12 weeks before you are due to return to the UK.\nAGRI-hr - https://www.agri-hr.com \nConcordia (UK) Ltd - https://www.concordia.org.uk/seasonal-work \nFruitful Jobs : https://www.fruitfuljobs.com/seasonal-worker-scheme\nHOPS Labour Solutions Ltd - https://www.hopslaboursolutions.com/sws \nPro-Force Limited - https://www.pro-force.co.uk/support/visa-information"

    "text": "1.4 Culture and Community\nThe United Kingdom is made up of four countries: England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Each of these nations has their own unique history, traditions and culture. England, Scotland and Wales together are known as Great Britain and the people who live there are known as British, and also as English, Northern Irish, Scottish, or Welsh.\nCities in the UK have many different kinds of people and have more options for entertainment, food and society. Smaller towns and rural areas are usually less diverse, quieter and more traditionally British. \nBritish people are friendly and helpful but they are also respectful of personal space. For example, it is considered rude to get too close to someone unless it is necessary, such as on a crowded train. Often a person will say sorry even if another person accidentally bumps into them! The British are also respectful of privacy and do not expect to discuss their personal relationships or business with someone they do not know very well. \nIt is considered rude to push your way to the front of a queue in Britain. You must wait your turn. \nAt work, a handshake is the correct way to greet someone. Otherwise a smile and nod will do for greeting others. \nIn the UK, you are expected to be on time for work and social engagements. \nUK culture values equality and respect. It is expected that you will treat everyone respectfully regardless of their position, age, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexuality or disability. \n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish is used in all parts of the UK but there are other official languages such as Welsh, Irish and Gaelic. \n\nAlcohol:\nIt is common to gather with friends to meet in a pub for drinks. Alcohol may be purchased in the UK when you are 18 years of age and you will have to show proof that you are of age. It is illegal to purchase alcohol on behalf of a person under that age.\nIt is never acceptable to drink alcohol or be drunk when driving or working.\n\nWeather:\nThe weather in the UK is very unpredictable. It can be cold and wet at any time of year. It can rain frequently, but snow is rare in most of the country. Temperatures in the summer rarely get higher than 30 degrees Celsius. \nIt is colder in the northern part of the country and in Scotland where temperatures will get below freezing in winter. You will want to make sure you bring a warm, waterproof coat and warm clothing as many older buildings are not well-heated."

You may be asked to complete or sign documents to say that you have received and understood training.\n\nAccidents, incidents, and illness \nIf you have an accident at work, or something at work makes you ill, you must tell your employer. You may be interviewed to find out exactly what happened, and it is important that you tell the truth so that a proper investigation can take place. \nInvestigations in the UK happen to help businesses understand how accidents happen, so that they can make changes to prevent them happening to someone else."

    "text": "2.14 Making Complaints\nYou may have problems or concerns about your work, pay, working conditions or relationships with other workers that you need help to put right. \nYou may just need to talk with your manager to get a complaint resolved. Your contract should tell you about the process for making a complaint. You can also contact your Scheme Operator if the farm is not resolving your problem.\nIf you are not able to resolve your complaint informally, or if your issue is very serious and you need to take it further, you can begin the process of raising a grievance. This is a formal procedure which your employer is legally required to follow. The process for raising a grievance should also be in your contract. If not, you can contact ACAS for advice. (https://www.acas.org.uk/grievance-procedure-step-by-step. )\nYou can also see the Get Help section for more organisations that can help you if you have a problem at work that is not solved by your employer."

Contact your Scheme Operator if you wish to transfer to a different employer in the Seasonal Worker Scheme.\nIf you request a transfer, your operator will seek to offer an alternative job if one is available. However, it is unlikely that you will be able to move to a specific job that you request.\nYou can only transfer to a grower that your sponsor works with. You are not permitted to work with or change your sponsor whilst working in the UK.\nYou should not be threatened or punished for requesting a transfer. You are permitted to leave the UK and end your employment at any time.\nWarning: You may only change jobs to work for another employer who is approved by your operator. Switching to a job not in the Seasonal Workers Scheme is illegal and puts you at risk of deportation. \n\nThe farm can also end your job early for the following reasons: \nIf you do not do your job well or quickly enough (after following an appropriate disciplinary process- see your contract or training)\nIf you do not follow farm rules regarding accommodation, health and safety, and any other farm rules (after following an appropriate disciplinary process - see your contract or training)\nThe harvest ends  \nThe scheme operator may arrange to move you to a different farm if the crop is finished or there is no longer any work available. This will usually be arranged in advance according to the season. The Scheme Operator will end your contract at the end of 26 weeks or earlier if there is no available work at another farm."

Usually 4-6 people will live in a caravan together and share a room with another worker. There will be a description of your accommodation in the information given to you by your sponsor. \nMost accommodation will include simple kitchen facilities and toilet and shower facilities in your caravan or shared facilities nearby. You should receive a list of what things will be provided for you at the accommodation such as bedding, pots and pans, or other items. \nSome farms provide free wifi and other farms charge a fee to use it.\nAccommodation costs are the only deductions which can be counted against your minimum wage allowance and that is only by up to £69.93 per week less than the minimum wage.\nIf you are earning more than the Minimum Wage you may be charged for other items (such as electricity and gas) but these charges should be explained to you first.\nIf you are working in Scotland, there are different laws that apply regarding your rights about the cost of accommodation. You can find out more about your rights and contract in Scotland in this factsheet (available in several languages). (https://www.sasa.gov.uk/covid-19-guidance/seasonal-agricultural-workers)"

    "text": "3.3 Personal\nReligion\nThe UK’s official religion is Christianity, and churches of all kinds can be found throughout the UK. The other main religions practised here are Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, Judaism and Buddhism. \nIn larger towns in the UK it is easy to find somewhere to practise your faith, as well as a community of people to welcome you, at a church, mosque, gurdwara, temple or synagogue. In smaller towns, you may only find Christian churches. \nMany people in the UK choose to wear their items of religious dress every day (such as turbans, hijabs and yarmulkes) and to observe religious festivals, such as Christmas, Eid, Diwali or Hanukkah. There may be some jobs where you cannot wear certain items of clothing because of health and safety or hygiene rules. You should discuss this with your employer before you start work if this is a concern for you.\nBe aware that some working environments cannot provide prayer breaks during working hours. Ask your operator if you have concerns about this. \n\nManaging your Money\nBank and ATM Access\nBring enough money with you to pay for travel to the farm, food, and other things you will need before you get your first wages. At least £200 is recommended.\nAs a seasonal worker you will not be able to open a bank account in the UK. Your employer or operator can help you open an online bank account through alternative payment solution providers such as:\nOnePay - https://www.onepay.com/ \nRevolut - https://www.revolut.com/\nSuits Me - https://suitsmecard.com/ \nUnizest - https://unizest.co.uk/ \nMake sure you understand what fees you will need to pay before signing up with any financial service. \nWhen you have an online bank account, keep the details (bank address, IBAN, account number) safe and do not allow anyone else to control your bank account. To transfer money back home, you can use software applications and money transfer operators. It is a good idea to set this up before you leave home and make decisions about who you will send the money to and what they will do with it.  \nIf someone is controlling your bank account with your full agreement, then you may be being exploited.
